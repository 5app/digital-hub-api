# Bulk Upload Content

Given a directory of data, these scripts will process the CSV content and upload the content in relative files as assets on the 5app platform

e.g. 

~/sample
  - assets.csv
  - assetCollections.csv
  - files/*
  - thumbnails/*


# CSV data formats

The file needs to be in CSV format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180 and values should be double-quoted where appropriate.

- Each row pertains to a single record
- Each column 
	- Provides the name of the field at the top - on the first row.
	- The order of the columns is not important
	- Column titles are not case-sensitive
	- Fields marked with a `*` are required

```bash
node -r dotenv/config bulk-upload/bulk-upload ~/sample
