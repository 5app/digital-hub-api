# Import users

Takes a users' JSON file as an input and create accounts for them.

## TODO
- Describe the JSON format
- Other parameters like the default language (if none was specified in the JSON file)
- Login details and selection of the domain
- Considerations for the teams like team name length (limited to 20 characters for now due to the primary key created by concatenating the domain name and the 20 first characters of the team name)
